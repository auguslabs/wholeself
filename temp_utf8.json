Her dedication to social justice, inclusivity, and helping others empower themselves reflects her compassionate and transformative approach to mental health care. Allie utilizes CBT, DBT, Somatic and a �real� talk approach. She deeply believes in self determination and paving a way forward in where the client is in the driver seat of their own mental health journey.\n\nShe finds joy and rejuvenation in her queer little family with her 4 dogs, bearded dragon, 4 sisters and her husband, Dany.
